A 2D RPG procedurally generated map, where in every room, you experience a different type of mental illness, such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, social anxiety, or panic disorder. 

The game is very abstract, and may resemble an artgame in some ways. 

The game might be a little  frustrating, as it aims to recreate some mental illnesses within the game play.

How To Play:
Find the lever in every room to unlock the doors. 
Look between the rooms for the treasure box.
Jump into the hole if you decide to give up.
Use arrow keys/WASD to move your character, and you may press R to restart.
In every room, the character controls will change accordingly to the disease related to the room.
